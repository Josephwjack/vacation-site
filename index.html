  <h2>The history</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Greece was the birthplace of <b>Democracy</b></li>
    <li>Greece' capital Athens is the oldest capital in Europe</li>
    <li>The Greek language is considered to be one of the oldest written languages still in use today.</li>
    <li>Home to 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</li>
  </ul>
